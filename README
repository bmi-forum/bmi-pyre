1. Build SNAC with Pyre on a recent Linux system

1.1 Building Pyre and Exchanger

1.1.1 libxml2 and MPICH
These two libraries are assumed to be available already.
Note that OpenMPI is currently NOT supported.

1.1.2 pythia-0.8
- Available at https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/pythia/
but use the version 0.8 included in this source tree with the following changes:
  - Fixed Makefile.am
    ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I ./m4 ==> ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4
  - Reconfigured with 
    autoreconf -i .
  - pympi.h added to packages/mpi/mpimodule

- Run ./configure
./configure --prefix=/Users/eunseo/projects/snac_bmi/pythia

- Make sure that the local sysconfig.pyc doesn't interefere the intallation step
make; make install
  - Ignore the following Python error at the last installation step
    ImportError: cannot import name get_config_var

1.1.3 Exchanger-1.0.1
- Contains classes to be inherited by StGermain and Snac's Exchanger module.
- Original source at https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/exchanger/
  but this source tree contains a modified version that skips pythia installation.
- configure
CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -I${PYTHIA_INCDIR}" ./configure --prefix=/Users/eunseo/projects/bmi-pyre/Exchanger
- make; make install (Note: the local sysconfig.pyc can confuse the install process).

1.2 SNAC
- For installation, see the user manual or INSTALL for quick start.
Basically, './configure; make'.

- Some customization of environment variables might be required 
prior to configuring and building SNAC with Pyre support.
The recommended set of environment variables is given below.
Note that some values need to be changed according to a user's setting.

In bash:
======================================================
export MPI_DIR=/usr
export MPI_BINDIR=${MPI_DIR}/bin
export MPI_INCDIR=${MPI_DIR}/include/mpich
export MPI_LIBDIR=${MPI_DIR}/lib
export PATH=${MPI_BINDIR}:{$PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${MPI_LIBDIR}:{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

export PYTHIA_DIR=${HOME}/projects/bmi-pyre/pythia
export PYTHIA_INCDIR=${PYTHIA_DIR}/include/pythia-0.8
export PYTHIA_LIBDIR=${PYTHIA_DIR}/lib
export PYTHIA_BINDIR=${PYTHIA_DIR}/bin
export PATH=${PYTHIA_BINDIR}:${PATH}
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHIA_LIBDIR}/python2.7/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}

export EXCHANGER_DIR=${HOME}/projects/bmi_pyre/Exchanger
export EXCHANGER_INCDIR=${EXCHANGER_DIR}/include
export EXCHANGER_LIBDIR=${EXCHANGER_DIR}/lib
export EXCHANGER_BINDIR=${EXCHANGER_DIR}/bin
export PATH=${PYTHIA_BINDIR}:${PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PYTHIA_LIBDIR}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHIA_LIBDIR}/python2.7/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}

export SNAC_DIR=${HOME}/projects/bmi_pyre/build
export SNAC_BINDIR=${SNAC_DIR}/bin
export SNAC_INCDIR=${SNAC_DIR}/include
export SNAC_LIBDIR=${SNAC_DIR}/lib
export SNAC_MODDIR=${SNAC_DIR}/Python
export PATH=${SNAC_BINDIR}:{$PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${SNAC_LIBDIR}:{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export PYTHONPATH=${SNAC_MODDIR}:${PYTHONPATH}
======================================================

2. Build SNAC with Pyre on OS X

Building SNAC with Pyre support on OS X is still experimental but 
in principle, the steps described above can be followed.
